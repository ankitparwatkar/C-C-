# C-and-C-Plus-Plus
C is a powerful, low-level programming language often used for system programming and embedded systems due to its efficiency. C++ builds on C by adding object-oriented features, making it suitable for software development, game programming, and performance-critical applications. Both languages provide fine control over system resources.
